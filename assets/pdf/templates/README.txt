# PDF Template Output

When outputting the PDF templates it is required that they be output in PDF version 1.3 format. 

Included in this directory is an Adobe PDF Presets option that can be imported in to Illustrator that will set the preferred options on PDF export. Import the file `Moz.joboptions` in to the Adobe PDF Presets in Illustrator and then select the Moz preset when exporting PDF templates.
